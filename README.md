# Bookmarks-reader

You bookmark some webpages directly on your hard drive ?

Bookmarks-reader searches and displays all links embed in those files on one web page. Links are sorted by folders like in your filesystem.

It supports '.ul', '.URL' or '.desktop' files extensions.

## How to use it
Put all your files into ['/bookmars'](https://github.com/dvdn/bookmarks-reader/blob/master/inc/bookmarks.php#L5 "go to bookmarks folder") folder.
You're done.

You can configure root '/bookmarks' folder name in [bookmars.php](https://github.com/dvdn/bookmarks-reader/blob/master/inc/bookmarks.php#L5 "go to inc/bookmarks.php") file.
